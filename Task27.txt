Task-9 RandomForest and DecisionTree
optimizations:
    Reduced Raandom Forest trees from 100 to 30 to speed up predictions 
    reduced max depth of trees to 5 and 4
Results:
    Prediction time is reduced significantly, accuracy remained high and comparable 

Task-10 K-Means clustering model
optimizations:
    Removed unnecessary plots and used the k with elbow method and add n_initials to 10
Results:
    The model runs fast and didnt get toggel.

Task-11: 
optimizations:
    Add infer_objects to remove the without any warning and used the max_depth to 4 
Results:
    The model gives better classifications and no arguments

Task-13:
optimizations :
    Try adding the pipeline to the Navi Bayes model 
Results: 
    The result been the same

Task-15: SVM MODEL 
optimizations:
    Added the Standard scaler 
    Used the Pipeline and used kernel rfb to linear
    changed the model complexity c from 1 to 10 and others
Results:
    The R2 score goes from o.39 to 0.95 and the model gives less errors which is MSE from 0.15 to 0.012

Task16: Neural Network using Sequential model
optimizations:
    Used the dropout to prevent the overfitting
    Increased the number of epoches from 50 to 100 and add the early stopping
Results:
    The test accuracy and the final training accuracyand the final validation accuracy increased
    The jump is from 0.96 to 0.99  both the test and validation
    The training is jumped from 0.96 to 0.9756 

Task17: RNN model
optimizations: 
    Used the MinMax scaler and used the dropout and the early stopping
Results:
    The plot had a significant change in the predictions

Task 18:
